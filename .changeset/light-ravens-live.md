"permissionless": patch

1. Account type for smartAccountCLient will be inferred automatically, so you will not have to pass `account` everywhere in functions like `sendTransaction`
2. Switching tests to vitest to enable type testing for better types in future
3. Better types for all the actions, we prettify all the args & return types
